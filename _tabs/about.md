My name is Valdemar Car√∏e, and I am a Security Advisor at a danish company called Improsec A/S. My position revolves around a variety of cyber security related activities, including red teaming, penetration testing, reverse engineering, offensive tool development, and more.

I am an extrovert and positive person, who enjoys developing myself as well as mentoring others into being their best selves both mentally and professionally.

# Credentials

In July 2021, I achieved a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I wrote my dissertation on virtualization-based obfuscation techniques and the restoration of procedures which have been protected by commercial products. The project culminated in the development of a devirtualization engine for Themida, one of the globally leading commercial packers for Windows binaries.

On top of that, I retain 12 cyber security certifications, including the OSCP, the OSCE and the recently famous OSCE3. I have completed multiple cyber security training labs, including the APTLabs and Cybernetics pro labs from Hack The Box, and have placed first in a variety of CTF competitions either as an individual performance or with my CTF team, Crusaders of Rust.
